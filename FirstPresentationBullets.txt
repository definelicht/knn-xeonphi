1. Introduction to problem
  - KNN
  - KD-trees (animation?)
  - Mention of approximation and randomized variation used in practice
2. Introduction to FLANN
  - Current state of the art: delegates to different algorithms.
  - Why is it state of the art? (used in OpenCV)
  - Show FLANN results
  - Specify subdomain: randomized kd-tree, higher accuracy
  - Mention bruteforce GPU algorithm
3. Current results:
  - Bruteforce algorithm
  - Working kd-tree
  - (Working approximation/randomized?)
4. Xeon Phi:
  - Memory management/caches
  - Parallization schemes:
    - One copy of tree
    - Multiple copies of tree (n cores per n randomized trees)
    - Tree on each core (only for small datasets)
    - Bruteforce using matrix library
  - MPI for communication
5. Milestones
  - Bruteforce [DONE]
  - kd-tree [DONE]
  - Randomized approximate kd-trees on CPU [MAYBE DONE] 
  - Parallelize using MPI
  - Tuning to Xeon Phi
