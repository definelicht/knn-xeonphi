0.) Briefly introduce problem again:
    - Randomized KD-Trees (example application)
    - What is our focus? -> Parallelize tree build & search

1.) Introduce benchmark code (FLANN)

2.) Tree-Build
    - Work-Stealing approach (refers to stuff from lecture)
    - TBB is used (justify why)
    - Scaling against FLANN on CPU

3.) kNN-Search
    - Briefly explain how it works
    - Show performance agianst FLANN on CPU

4.) Xeon Phi
    - Achieved Gflop/s / GB/s (briefly)
    - Discuss issues/difficulties
